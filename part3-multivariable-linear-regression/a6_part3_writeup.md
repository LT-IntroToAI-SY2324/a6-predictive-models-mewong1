# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
0.86 is my r squared value. This means that there is a pretty high correlation between the age and miles of a car and the price of it
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
My model is mosly accurate. Since my r^2 value is greater than 0.7, it is considered accurate. 

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
My model predicts a 10 year old car with 89000 miles is worth 11943.59 dollars and that a 20 year old car with 150000 miles is 5892.51 dollars.

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
This means the the car is worth little to nothing. It has probably been used so long as for so many miles that it wouldn't sell for much of anything.
