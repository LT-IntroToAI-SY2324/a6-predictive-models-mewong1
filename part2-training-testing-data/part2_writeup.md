# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective than the model I created in the previous lesson because there is more data used to make analysis

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
R squared reveals the correlation between blood pressure and age. The value of R squared varies around the value .5, which means there is not a strong correlation between the 2 variables.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would say that this model is mostly accurate. For the age 17, the predicted value is 112.36 whole the actual y value is 114. These values are pretty similar. For the age 39, the predicted y value is 132.25 while the actual value is 144. These values are very differemt. According to the American Heart Association,
